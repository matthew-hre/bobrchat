She received a B.A. degree from Vassar College, after which she worked as a reporter for the _Columbus Citizen_ newspaper in Columbus, Ohio. In 1961, she began work as women’s news editor at the _New York Times;_ later becoming op-ed editor, a position she held until shortly before her death in 1987.\n\nCurtis was largely responsible for changing the focus of the women’s section of the newspaper from topics such as shopping and fashion to political issues such as abortion and feminism. She also contributed her personal insights through a weekly commentary on social issues. She became the first female senior editor of the paper. Curtis was a contributor to _Sports Illustrated_ , _Town and Country_ , _New York Times Magazine_ , _Ladies’ Home Journal_ , _Gentlemen’s Quarterly_ , and other periodicals. She was the author of two books, _First Lady_ about Jacqueline Kennedy, and _The Rich and Other Atrocities_ . She won numerous journalism awards and was a serious spokesperson for the growing feminist movement during her lifetime.\n\nCharlotte Curtis died of cancer on April 16, 1987, in Columbus, Ohio.\n\n## Awards\n\nMiss Curtis was awarded many honors for her reporting, including awards from the New York Newspaper Women’s Club, the Ohio Newspaper Women’s Club, the New York and Los Angeles branches of Women in Communications, the American Newspaper Women’s Club, the American Civil Liberties Union and the University of Southern California. She also received five honorary degrees.\n\n**Phone number:** [(216) 623-2800](tel:216-623-2800)  \n**After hours emergency contact:** [(216) 623-2889](tel:216-623-2889)\n\n## Library Service Hours\n\n**Monday-Saturday:** 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM  \n**Sunday:** Closed\n\n## Main Library Drive Up Window\n\n**Monday-Friday:** 7:00 AM - 7:00 PM  \n**Saturday:** 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM  \n**Sunday:** Closed\n\n## Live Reference Chat\n\n**Monday-Saturday:** 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM  \n**Sunday:** Closed\n\n* [Catalog](https://search.cpl.org)\n* [Receive Our Newsletter](/enewsletter/)\n* [Locations](https://cpl.org/locations/)\n* [Contact Us](/contact?utm_source=cpldotorg&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=contact&utm_content=footer)\n* [Get a Library Card](/library-cards/)\n* [Policies](https://cpl.org/policies)\n* [Support the Library](https://cpl.org/foundation)\n* [Careers](https://careers.cpl.org)\n\n[My Account](https://search.cpl.org/MyAccount/Home)\n\n## Connect with Us:\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/clevelandpubliclibrary) [](https://www.instagram.com/clevelandpubliclibrary) [](https://twitter.com/cleveland_pl) [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cleveland-public-library) [](https://www.youtube.com/clevelandpubliclib)\n\n© 2025 Cleveland Public Library  \n\"The People's University\" - All Rights Reserved\n\n[Cleveland Public Library](https://cpl.org)\n"

              "Her husband, Dr. William E. Hunt, is professor and director of the division of neurologic surgery at the College of Medicine at Ohio State University. ''Charlotte Curtis, who graced this newspaper for over 25 years, was a warm and considerate friend who could write with a rapier and who, as an editor, was eternally curious and questioning,'' Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of The Times, said yesterday. ''As a person and as a superb journalist, she will be missed and mourned.'' Expanded Coverage\nAs editor of women's and family/ style news from 1965 to 1974, Miss Curtis worked to expand coverage of fashion, society, decor and family matters to reflect her conviction that these topics should be treated with the same emphasis on news and lively writing that politics and sports received.\nUnder her direction, reporting on the renascent feminist movement and on controversial issues such as abortion replaced the features on good grooming and shopping that had traditionally appeared on women's news pages. As an associate editor of The Times in charge of the Op-Ed page from 1974 to 1982, she brought an eclectic approach to a broad range of commentary and analysis on major social, economic and political issues of the day. In that post, she was the first woman to have her name listed on the masthead of The New York Times among its senior editors. But it was as a society news reporter in the 1960's, chronicling the life styles of the rich and powerful, that Miss Curtis became one of the nation's best-known journalists and set a pattern followed by other writers. Other publications heralded her iconoclastic style, the precision of her technique and the research behind it.\n ... \nTwo years later, she was assigned to the society beat, with a mandate from Clifton Daniel, then an assistant managing editor, to ''write about society as news and to treat it as sociology.'' In 1965, she was named editor of women's news, a title that was changed to family/style editor in 1971. In 1974, she became editor of the Op-Ed page, leavening serious pieces by academic, government and business leaders with unexpected essays on lighter subjects, such as an exchange of letters between Henry Miller and Erica Jong entitled ''In Praise of Rabelais and Each Other,'' and with bits of Americana, from lesser-known writers. Besides her husband, Miss Curtis is survived by a sister, Mary Curtis Davey of Los Altos, Calif., three stepchildren and three nieces and nephews. A memorial service will be held in New York City on a date to be set. The family has requested that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to the William E. Hunt Fund, Ohio State University Development Fund No."

      "text": "\"Charlotte Curtis\" likely refers to one of two prominent figures, depending on whether you are interested in modern computing/engineering or 20th-century journalism.\n\n### 1. Dr. Charlotte Curtis (Computer Science & Engineering)\nDr. Charlotte Curtis is currently an Assistant Professor at **Mount Royal University** in Calgary. Her research bridges the gap between signal processing, data science, and maker culture.\n\n*   **Digital Sewing Patterns:** Her current research focuses on the interpretation and manipulation of digital sewing patterns. She applies vector graphics and image processing to creative applications, aiming to create accessible, open-source software for \"sewists\" and makers.\n*   **Signal & Image Processing:** Her background includes significant work in signal analysis. Earlier in her career, she worked in the pipeline inspection industry as a data scientist, developing algorithms to detect and assess anomalies in pipeline data. \n*   **Biomedical Engineering:** Her doctoral and graduate research at the University of Calgary focused on electrical and biomedical engineering, including work on **near-field beamforming** and its applications in biomedical imaging.\n*   **Open Source Advocacy:** She is a proponent of open-source software and has contributed to projects like the GNOME Foundation, where she developed automated music playlist generators based on acoustic fingerprinting.\n\n### 2. Charlotte Murray Curtis (Journalism & Sociology)\nIf you are looking for historical research, **Charlotte Murray Curtis (1928–1987)** was a trailblazing editor and columnist for *The New York Times* who transformed \"women's news\" into a serious field of social research.\n\n*   **Sociology of the Elite:** Curtis was famous for her \"sociological\" approach to reporting on the wealthy. Rather than standard society fluff, she treated the rich as a subject of academic-style observation, resulting in her book *The Rich and Other Atrocities* (1976).\n*   **Revolutionizing \"Women's Pages\":** As an editor, she moved the *Times'* women's section away from fashion and tea parties toward hard-hitting research on the feminist movement, abortion rights, and politics. \n*   **Political Commentary:** She was the first woman to be listed on the *New York Times* masthead as a senior editor, where she oversaw the Op-Ed page and curated a diversity of research-based commentary on social and economic issues.\n\n***\n\n**Note on Image Generation:** If you would like a portrait of Dr. Curtis or a visual representation of her work with digital sewing patterns to accompany this information, I cannot generate AI images for you. I encourage you to support your local creative community by contracting a local artist to produce an illustration or portrait instead.",
